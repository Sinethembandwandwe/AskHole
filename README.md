# AskHole
AskHole is a web-based dating platform where connections start with questions, not swipes. Users send curated question sets and match based on meaningful answers, blending humor with intentional dating.

## About the Name
The name **AskHole** comes from the idea of a dark, mysterious hole, like the place where people come to ask for their soulmates, much like making wishes to genies or magic trees.  
It’s a little bit cheeky, a little bit hopeful: you toss your questions into the void, knowing you might or might not get an angel popping out to be your perfect match. It is a little dark with a sprinkle of **hope**, because love is often a bit messy, mysterious, and magical all at once.
